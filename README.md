- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dayuhnah
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web dev and ui/ux as I am constantly looking at website and trying to think of a better way to improve on it (especially my own projects... i'm a huge critique of my own work zzz but it makes me a very detail-oriented person! see, im quite optimistic too)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning whatever language I could possily get a hold of. As a current undergraduate student in uni, it challenges me to learn new things for projects and modules! For instance, I'm currently learning kotlin as I learn how to develop a proper android application using Android Studio.. oh! im also trying to venture into data analysis and ai bots on the side as well. I'm really interested in the whole idea of improving our lives with the usage of ai bots and how we can fully optimise it to our own good. (no terminators here okay)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me an email at dayanamarsya@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I wake up in the middle of the night to debug things because it would appear in my sleep....... not so fun fact for me to be honest hahaha
